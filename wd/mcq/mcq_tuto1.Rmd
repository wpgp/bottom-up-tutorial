.center2[*The **Bechdel test** measures the representation of women in film. It is based on three criteria
and films either pass the test or fail. *

Let π, a random value between 0 and 1, 
denote the unknown proportion of movies that pass the Bechdel test. ]

# Bayesian concepts

.center2[Three friends – the **feminist**, the **clueless**, and the **optimist** – have some prior ideas about π.

# Bayesian estimation

.center2[What does the parameter `warmup` control in stan?
1. the number of iterations
2. the length of the chain
3. the number of iterations post-tuning
4. the length of the chain pre-tuning]

.pull-right[
This is a **traceplot**.

*NB: we can see that the model run for 750 iterations.*

Can we consider that the model converged?
1. Yes
2. No

# Practical question

.center2[
How far have you managed to read tutorial 1?

1. I didn't have time to read it
2. Until section 1: *From a frequentist to a Bayesian mindset*
3. Until section 2: *Let’s try with simulated data*
4. Until section 3: *Modelling Population count: a Poisson distribution*
5. Until section 4: *Modelling Population count: a Poisson Lognormal model*
6. I have read it all
]

# Practical question

.center2[
Which model did you manage to run?

1. The Normal model with simulated data
2. And the Poisson model with true data
3. And the Lognormal model with true data
4. None

# Model evaluation

*Let's consider a population model with full convergence of the estimates.*

*We evaluate it by comparing the predicted population counts versus 
the observed population counts*

# Model evaluation

*Let's consider a population model with full convergence of the estimates.*

*We evaluate it by comparing the predicted population counts versus 
the observed population counts and we obtain the following goodness-of-fit metrics*

Can we be confident about the model results? <br/>
1.Yes <br/>
2.No

# Today's program

Now we will have a session for questions.

.center2[After it would you prefer that we end the presentation of tutorial 1 or 
that we start tutorial 2?

1.  End tutorial 1
2.  Start tutorial 2]
