# Statistical population modelling for census support

This github repo contains the raw teaching materials for the [**Statistical Population Modelling for Census Support workshop,**](https://wpgp.github.io/bottom-up-tutorial/) funded by the [United Nations Population Fund](<https://www.unfpa.org/>). It has been developed by the [WorldPop Research Group](<https://www.worldpop.org/>), University of Southampton.

The repo consists in a series of tutorials in **Bayesian statistics for population modelling** with hands-on experience. It includes example code and other resources designed to expedite the learning curve.

The key concepts that are covered in the tutorial series include:
1.  Introduction to software for Bayesian statistical modelling:  R and Stan,
2.  Simple linear regression in a Bayesian context,
3.  Random effects to account for settlement type (e.g. urban/rural) and other types of stratification in survey data,
4.  Quantifying and mapping uncertainties in population estimates and
5.  Diagnostics to evaluate model performance (e.g. cross-validation).

It has been first taught to the Brazilian Stats Office, [Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE)](https://www.ibge.gov.br/en/home-eng.html), in October 2021.

# Folder content

The relevant materials are in the [`tutorials`](https://github.com/wpgp/bottom-up-tutorial/tree/main/tutorials) folder.

Each tutorial has its dedicated folder that contains:
- Tutorial material
  -  The `R` code
  -  The `stan` code
-  Background files
  - The `html` code for the website page
  - The `R markdown` code that has been used to produce the `html` page
  - The `references.bib` with references used for the tutorial

The `data` folder contains outputs of the tutorial.
