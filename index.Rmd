Statistical population modelling is a powerful tool for producing gridded population estimates to support census activities. [WorldPop](https://www.worldpop.org/) at the University of Southampton is a global leader in developing these methods and has partnered with the [United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)](https://www.unfpa.org/) to provide support to national statistics offices in training and production of high-resolution gridded population estimates from existing data sources (e.g. household surveys, building footprints, administrative records, census projections).

This website provides a series of tutorials in **Bayesian statistics for population modelling** and hands-on experience to start developing the necessary skills. It includes example code and other resources designed to expedite the learning curve as much as possible.

The key concepts that are covered in the tutorial series include:

1.  Introduction to software for Bayesian statistical modelling:  R and Stan,

2.  Simple linear regression in a Bayesian context,

3.  Random effects to account for settlement type (e.g. urban/rural) and other types of stratification in survey data,

4.  Quantifying and mapping uncertainties in population estimates and

5.  Diagnostics to evaluate model performance (e.g. cross-validation).

The material has been used during a remote workshop with the Brazilian Stats Office, Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE), in October 2021.
