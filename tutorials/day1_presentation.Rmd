# Why Bayesian statistics?

class: center, middle

# But what is Bayesian statistics?

---
class: center, middle

### 1.  Bayesian statistics are a **knowledge building process**

# A daily-life example

###Bayesian philosophy: 
1.  having *prior* information about a phenomenon
2.  interpreting incoming data in light of this *prior*
3. concluding with an updated information or *posterior*]

# Test your Bayesian thinking

.center2[*When flipping a fair coin, we say that ‘the probability of flipping Heads is 0.5.’* 

How do you interpret this probability?

1. If I flip this coin over and over, roughly 50% will be Heads.
2. Heads and Tails are equally plausible.]

.footnote[[Chapter 1, Bayes Rules! An Introduction to Bayesian Modeling with R ](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/chapter-1.html)]

---

.center2[*An election is coming up and a pollster claims that ‘candidate A has a 0.9 probability of winning.’* 

How do you interpret this probability?

1. If we observe the election over and over, candidate A will win roughly 90% of the time.
2. Candidate A is much more likely to win than to lose.
3. The pollster’s calculation is wrong. Candidate A will either win or lose, thus their probability of winning can only be 0 or 1.]

.center2[*Consider two claims:* 

*(1) Zuofu claims that he can predict the outcome of a coin flip. 
To test his claim, you flip a fair coin 10 times and he correctly predicts all 10.* 

*(2) Kavya claims that she can distinguish natural and artificial sweeteners.
To test her claim, you give her 10 sweetener samples and she correctly identifies each* 

What do you conclude?

1. You’re more confident in Kavya’s claim than Zuofu’s claim.
2. The evidence supporting Zuofu’s claim is just as strong as the evidence supporting Kavya’s claim.]

# Defining probability

> ### **Bayesian philosophy**: probability measures the *relative plausibility* of an event.

--
> ### **Frequentist philosophy**: probability measures the *long-run relative frequency* of a *repeatable* event.

### 3.  Bayesian statistics are **transparent about the assumptions made**

# Bayes rule

$$ \text{posterior} \quad = \quad \frac{\text{prior } \cdot \text{ likelihood}}{\text{normalizing constant}} \; $$

<br> 
**Prior proability model** <br />
It captures our belief about the phenomenon. prior to seeing any data.

**Likelihood**<br />
It represents the range of parameter values accompanied by
the likelihood that each parameter explains the data we are observing.

**Posterior probability model**<br />
It summarises the plausibility of a phenomenon.


---
# Toy example

#### Modeller's question: *Will it rain tomorrow the 27th September 2021 in the UK?*

<br>
--

**Prior proability model**: <br />
It rains 60% of the time in September in the UK.

--

**Likelihood**<br />
It is sunny today and climate models say that weather is stable in 40% of the case.

--

**Posterior probability model** <br />
Knowing the weather of today in the UK and climate models,
we can update the prior information of the weather for the 27th September in the UK.

As we collect more data, priors lose their influence.

### 4.  Bayesian statistics account for the **uncertainty in the model**
---
# Uncertainty quantification

--

### Sources of uncertainty <br />
- Missing predictors
--

- Errors in data collection
--

- Imperfect representativity of the sample
--

- Individual variation

<br> 
--

#### **Parameters are considered as variable and thus have a distribution**

--
#### **Predictions are considered as variable and thus have a distribution**

### 5.  Bayesian models makes you think about your question in terms of **distributions**

#Why Bayesian statistics ?

--
### Principled

--

### Flexible

### Good with missing data

### Humble

# Estimating Bayesian models

# Markov chain Monte Carlo

#### **Goal**: Approximating the posterior distribution via simulation

**Monte Carlo** <br />
Estimate a parameter by generating random numbers and checking if it corrersponds to the structure

# Markov chain Monte Carlo

**Markov chain** <br />
Sequences of samples probabilistically related

# Markov chain Monte Carlo

#### **Goal**: Approximating the posterior distribution via simulation

**MCMC** <br />
1. Pick a random parameter value
2. Evaluate how likely the value explains the data given the prior belief and the model
3. Draw another value depending on the goodness of the previous value

# Stan


[Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) is a probabilistic programming language
for Bayesian estimation

Language- and platform-agnostic back-end  with a
**wide range of front-ends**:
- Shell (“CmdStan”)
- **R (“RStan”) **
- Python (“PyStan”) 
- Matlab (“MatlabStan”)
- Stata (“StataStan”)
- Julia (“JuliaStan”)

Two step compilation process: model in `stan` code, translated to `C++` and compiled in a standalone binary
